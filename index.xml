      <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes sense in Christmas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our children dressed in Santa outfit or receiving gifts from Santa does not make sense.
Our family picture in our best dresses with Merry Christmas scribbled does not make sense.
The only thing that makes sense is the picture of God&amp;rsquo;s Love in baby Jesus lying in a manger with an eye to the cross of Calvary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why we celebrate Christmas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the day when God gave us a child - Jesus Christ, who will be whipped so that we may be healed, whose hands and feet will be nailed so that we may be forgiven, whose forehead would bleed from a crown of thorns pressed down so that our curses may be broken, whose body will be pierced with spear so that our lives can be spared, whose body will be hung on a cross so that we may receive life though his death.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What happened on Christmas?

      <title>Problem of evil</title>
      <link>https://abhynadar.github.io/arcanvas/thought/problem-of-evil/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two solutions to the problem of evil -  take away the freewill or deliver instant justice. Neither of these solutions are attractive. So God came up with another one, mercy and grace through Jesus Christ. Unfortunately some reject this too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people say - &amp;ldquo;God is trying to teach me something by this sickness&amp;rdquo;.
If it is so then why not focus all your energy into finding out and learning quickly what it is that God is trying to teach you, rather than wasting your time, resources and energy in doctors and medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
